Life is beautiful is a comedy/ drama film that was directed by Roberto Benigni, 
and released on November 6th of 1998. This movie is created in the time of the Holocaust 
in 1939 and shot in Arezzo, Italy. The film is based on a real-life story about a 
Jewish-Italian man named Rubino Romeo Salmoni, whose story is narrated through a 
young boy named Guido Orefice (Giorgio Cantarini). The director is trying to 
portray the Holocaust atrocities to the viewers in a powerful way that is still 
appropriate. This movie covers the treatment of the Jews/ non- Jews in ghettos and 
concentration camps, them being forcefully removed and expelled from their homes, 
and not being provided basic essential needs for survival, etc. Life is beautiful, 
is a useful historically accurate source that demonstrates the significance of the
 Holocaust by the showings of the major events of what happened in real life Canadian/world history.
